# Project: Rectangle Area Calculator

Objective: Create a C++ program that calculates the area of a rectangle.

Requirements:

Knowledge of basic C++ syntax.
Familiarity with compiling and running C++ programs.
Steps:

Write the C++ code:
Open your preferred text editor or IDE and create a new file named rectangle-area-calculator.cpp. Write the C++ code to calculate the area of a rectangle based on user input for length and width. Here's a basic template:

cpp
Copy code
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    double length, width;
    
    cout << "Enter length of the rectangle: ";
    cin >> length;
    
    cout << "Enter width of the rectangle: ";
    cin >> width;
    
    double area = length * width;
    
    cout << "Area of the rectangle: " << area << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
Save the file: Save the rectangle-area-calculator.cpp file in your desired directory.

Compile the program:
Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing rectangle_area.cpp, and compile the program using g++:

Copy code
g++ -o rectangle-area-calculator rectangle-area-calculator.cpp
This will generate an executable file named rectangle-area-calculator.

Run the program:
Execute the compiled program:

bash
Copy code
./rectangle-area-calculator
Follow the prompts to enter the length and width of the rectangle, and the program will calculate and display the area.

Test the program:
Test the program with various input values to ensure it calculates the area correctly.

Additional Challenges (Optional):

Modify the program to calculate the perimeter of the rectangle as well.
Add error handling to handle invalid user inputs.
Create a simple graphical user interface (GUI) using a library like Qt or GTK+.
